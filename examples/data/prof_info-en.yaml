        even with the Office templates (MS, Libre or Open). Especially if you want to reuse your data in another format,
        or in different languages. The solution adopted is templating with jinja2 (for LaTeX or HTML). Other
        possibilities are to use Sweave + knitr or Java + Freemarker. For the europass format there are already various document
        classes in CTAN. The system stores data in yaml files, but it is easily trasformable to databases storage. I
        selected yaml because it is easily modifiable in any place and it is not app dependant."
