  I have minimal computer skills. The computers are little things (or big ones) that do things programatically. On the other side, I am totally a random machine. When you ask me for Alice, I can perfectly answer for Bob or Cat or anything else or nothing at all. The minimal aptitud I have related to computer skills is with my capacity to push the button of the coffee machine.
