  I have minimal computer skills. The computers are little things (or big ones) that do things programatically. In the other side, I am totally a random machine. When you ask me for Alice, I can perfectly answer for Bob or Cat or anything else or nothing at all. The minimal aptitud I have to do computer skills is related with my capacity to push the button of the coffe machine.
